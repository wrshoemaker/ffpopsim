# Examples #
The ease at which population genetic simulations can be set up using FFPopSim is best appreciated by a couple of examples:

  * [Fitness valley crossing](valley.md)
  * [The benefits of sex](benefits.md): How does evolution speed up as individuals recombine more often?
  * [CTL escape dynamics in HIV](escape.md)
  * [HIV evolution in chronic infection](chronic_hiv.md)
  * [Genotype condensation due to epistasis](condensation.md)
