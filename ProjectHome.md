FFPopSim is a collection of C++ classes and a Python interface for efficient simulation of large populations, in particular when the product of mutation rate and population size is larger than one. It consists of one library for individual-based simulations, and a complementary one for simulation of the entire genotype distribution. The latter is coded efficiently using Fast-Fourier Transforms to speed up recombination operations.

**04/02/2013** updated FFPopSim now tracks genealogies of the population at specified loci!
